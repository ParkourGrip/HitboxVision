## What does it do?
When applied, the mutator makes character hitboxes visible ingame.
The way that these hitboxes are displayed is configurable in the configuration menu.
Body and head hitbox can be independently configured as well as the enemy, ally, red and blue team hitboxes.

## How to change the configuration?
To display the configuration menu open the console in-game and type `mutate hitboxvision` or `mutate hbv`.
After altering the configuration using the menu press the save button.

## Compatibility with other mutators
This mutator dose not use its own player character implementation and should be compatible with any custom implementation of player character.
